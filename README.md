# About Me
I am a motivated and detail-oriented Power BI Developer (Fresher) actively seeking job opportunities in the field of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. With hands-on experience in building interactive dashboards using Power BI, DAX, SQL, Excel, and REST APIs, I have developed projects such as a Mobile Sales Dashboard and a Weather Analytics Dashboard (linked below). I am passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights that support business decisions.

Currently based in Pune, I am available for full-time entry-level roles, and eager to contribute to data-driven projects in a professional environment.
